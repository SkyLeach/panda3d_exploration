#Unlicensed for any use
##disclaimer
This project will eventually have an open source license.  I (the author,
Matthew Gregory (@skyleach)) am unsure which FOSS license I wish to use at this
time.  There isn't anything in this project that is in any way proprietary, but
until I know how I want to relase this I don't want to worry about it.

So, in short, all rights are reserved until I decide which license to use.
Don't worry, there isn't anything here you want anyhow yet.  Eventually this
will be replaced with a genuine license once there is something worthwhile in
the project.
